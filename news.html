        In other crypto news today, Bitcoin miner CleanSpark and Bitcoin mining company GRIID have entered into a definitive merger agreement per which CleanSpark will acquire all the issued and outstanding common stock of GRIID in an all-stock transaction.</p>
        <p>The press release stated that the total enterprise value of the transaction is $155 million, including payment and assumption of debt. Furthermore, the companies also entered into an exclusive hosting agreement for all currently available power. 20 MW of that will be allocated to CleanSpark immediately. Also, GRIID stockholders will receive shares of CleanSpark common stock. CleanSpark will assume all outstanding debt and other obligations. It provided GRIID with a $5 million dollar working capital loan and a pay-down bridge loan of approximately $50.9 million that was used to satisfy certain obligations of GRIID at signing. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024.</p>
        <p>According to Zach Bradford, CleanSpark’s CEO, “this acquisition would give us a clear and steady path over the next three years to accomplish in Tennessee what we proudly achieved in Georgia over the past three years. That achievement was to build out over 400 MW of infrastructure backed by valuable, long-term power contracts.” “Together, we will achieve rapid growth in the Tennessee Valley,” commented Trey Kelly, GRIID’s CEO. Harry Sudock, GRIID’s CSO, added that “growing our portfolio of data centers in this attractive region positions us to continue strengthening the resilience of the power grid while delivering CleanSpark’s leading mining capabilities.”</p>
